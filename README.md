# Pig-Game

## Introcuction

Pig is a simple dice game that is played with a single six-sided die. The game is played by two or more players, and the objective is to be the first player to reach a certain number of points, which is typically 100.

**Rules:**

- Each player takes turns rolling the die.
- On each turn, a player can choose to either roll the die again or hold.
- If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they lose all the points they have accumulated during that turn.
- If a player holds, their turn ends and their points are added to their total score.
- The first player to reach the predetermined number of points wins the game.

In this project, I have recreated the Pig Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface design was created by Jonas Schmedtmann.
